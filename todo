-implement buffer option that offsets available time slot by buffer amount from previous event
-provide option to use ai to convert availability to sentences
-dark mode
-instead of text area for availability, make each slot a component so that each slot can be copied individually. slots for date can be copied together. copy availability for all dates
-when copy is clicked, change the button to show that it has been copied (maybe gray out, check mark for a few seconds)
-info bubbles that provide description on hover e.g. minimum slot duration explanation
-fix spacing
